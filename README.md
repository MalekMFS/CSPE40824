## How to run
You could run the project with `sbt run "<parameters>"` or just run the .jar file followed by following parameters (without quotes).
Note that all parameters are optional and have default values. Here are examples with default values.
* `-e 7` or `--expOfCust 7`: Indicates number of Customers (Jobs) in terms of power of ten.
The default is 7 (i.e 10^7).
* `-k 12` or `--queueSize 12`: Server's queue size.
* `--examiner`: Runs simulation only for lambda (Î») = 5, 10, 15
* `--debug`: Prints out more info like Arrival, Done, and Overdue events.
* `-m fixed`,`--mode fixed`: Switches between `analysis` mode and Simulation mode with `fixed` or `exp` theta (wait time) distributions.
